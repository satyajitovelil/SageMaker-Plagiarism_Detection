#### Contains the following notebooks along with the necessary scripts:

**Notebook 2: Feature Engineering**

* Clean and pre-process the text data.
* Define features for comparing the similarity of an answer text and a source text, and extract similarity features.
* Select "good" features, by analyzing the correlations between different features.
* Create train/test `.csv` files that hold the relevant features and class labels for train/test data points.

**Notebook 3: Train and Deploy Your Model in SageMaker**

* Upload your train/test feature data to S3.
* Define a binary classification model and a training script.
* Train your model and deploy it using SageMaker.
* Evaluate your deployed classifier.

> `Notebook 3 has two approaches:`
> 1. Uses sklearn to create classification model
> 2. Uses pytorch to create classification model
